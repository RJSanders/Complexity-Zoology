\section*{Abstract}

Complexity Zoology is a program that deduces complexity class inclusions and oracle 
separations from an initial data set. It is designed to aid the process of compiling 
information about complexity classes and the relationships between them.
This thesis is a description of Complexity Zoology and how it works, along with a 
survey of complexity theory conducted with the assistance of the Complexity Zoology 
software. We begin with an overview of commonly used computational models and of the
theory of complexity class operators. Then, the algorithm underlying Complexity 
Zoology is explained. Finally, we survey the landscape of complexity theory 
through the lens of Complexity Zoology's data set. We include both a detailed survey
involving a smaller number of classes and a bird's-eye view involving the full set 
of classes in Zoology's input file.
