Thanks are owed to several for making both Complexity Zoology and this thesis 
possible. Much of this project's data set is based on email correspondence between 
Greg Kuperberg, Scott Aaronson, and Lance Fortnow. Other contributors to these 
conversations include Lijie Chen, Avishay Tal, Justin Thaler, Prashant Vasudevan, 
John Watrous, and Jiapeng Zhang.

I also thank Greg Kuperberg for his extensive help with many aspects of the project:
adding to the data set, clarifying key concepts and arguments, facilitating 
conversations with experts in complexity theory, and writing the original version of
Complexity Zoology that served as the outline for this new version. Finally, I thank
my thesis committee---Eric Babson, Greg Kuperberg, and Bruno Nachtergaele---for 
their time and attention.
